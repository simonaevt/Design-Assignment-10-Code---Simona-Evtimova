Paragraph Explanation of Additional Components:

Firstly, within the css code, I used the ‘z-index in order to stack my icons on top of my bubble images. This was because I was using all png components that were custom created to mimic my prototypes, and I was adding png icons on top of png background boxes. I also decided to use containers in order to have them be within the dimensions of the containers I was creating for the toolbar, toolbar pop up, as well as the bottom vertical bar. Another main feature I decided to utilize from online resources was the ‘toggle’ since it allowed me to switch between the 2 states of my unclicked, and clicked png’s. I decided to do this manually since I wasn’t satisfied with the hover animations created in css, since I was aiming for a very specific visual look. Lastly, I also wanted to use an outside tutorial to create my placeholder and button, since I wanted it to disappear after the user input their information, which we did not learn throughout the quarter. For some additional context, I took Mary Boyle’s COGS 3 class, where I developed my own webpage using html, css, and javascript, so I have had some previous experience. This allowed me to be a little bit more complex with my code and implementation, and create something that was as visually appealing as my skills could allow.
